What should happen when you delete a reservation?

    Keep everything intact, but mark the reservation as inactive. When querying for available rooms and such, we'll have to check to make sure the res_rooms as inactive too.

We should be able to access past customers from a list when making new reservations to limit duplicate customers.

When updating a reservation, should the confirmation codes be editable? No.

Do we need the resRoomsController? Should all those routes be included on the api/reservations route?

All rooms associated with a reservation should have the same confirmation number as the first room on that reservation. When rooms are assigned, each room after the first will be assigned its own confirmation number.

We need to get history working so the back button in the browser doesn't always just take you back to the dashboard. On hold for now.
