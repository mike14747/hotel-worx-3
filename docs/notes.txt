What should happen when you delete a reservation?

    Delete the customer, reservation and all res_rooms from those 3 db tables.
    Delete the reservation and all res_rooms, but leave the customer record intact.
    Keep everything intact, but mark the reservation as inactive. We'd also have to mark the res_rooms as inactive too.

We should be able to access past customers from a list when making new reservations to limit duplicate customers.

When updating a reservation, should the reservation_id and res_rooms confirmation codes be editable?

Do we need the resRoomsController? Should all those routes be included on the api/reservations route?
