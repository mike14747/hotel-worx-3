What should happen when you delete a reservation?

    Keep everything intact, but mark the reservation as inactive. When querying for available rooms and such, we'll have to check to make sure the res_rooms as inactive too.

We should be able to access past customers from a list when making new reservations to limit duplicate customers.

When updating a reservation, should the confirmation codes be editable? No.

Do we need the resRoomsController? Should all those routes be included on the api/reservations route?

All rooms associated with a reservation should have the same confirmation number as the first room on that reservation. When rooms are assigned, each room after the first will be assigned its own confirmation number.

We need to get history working so the back button in the browser doesn't always just take you back to the dashboard. On hold for now.

We should have a navbar so you don't always have to go back to the dashboard to go to other pages.

CSTN - the guest didn't choose a room type. So, they can get assigned any type. Add another room type option to room_types and figure out how to implement.

Implement Passport JS auth into React... useContext?

------------------------------------------------------

the object that gets passed to the invoicesController needs to have the res_rooms property be an array of res_rooms

do we need to flag res_rooms as being paid or is the fact that they've been checked_out enough?

what other charge_types should we have (currently, we have: Phone, Laundry, Room Service, Restaurant, Wifi, Television, Misc)?

------------------------------------------------------

each invoice_id can have multiple:
 - charge_types
 - taxes
 - payment_types

------------------------------------------------------

Before making an invoice, we need to do the following:

 - know the reservation_id and the res_room_ids that are associated with the invoice
 - get the number of nights and rates for each res_room
 - get the charges associated with each res_room by reservation_id and res_room_id
 - calculate the taxes for each res_room

 ------------------------------------------------------

invoice_payments.js, invoice_res_rooms.js and invoice_taxes.js post methods need to have loops so they can add multiple rows of data

test payment_type model

each res_room gets an invoice... not each reservation and some total of res_rooms

add a cash field to res_rooms so they can't put any charges on the room

have a way to have special room rates (for groups/companies... which are lower, certain days of the week... which are higher)

we need to have companies table for rate discounts

add a company_id field (nullable) to the customer table
